And hopefully android (if this project doesn't die)\r\n\r\n## Specs\r\nCoincap: 41300000000 CAL\r\n\r\nBlocktime: 30 seconds\r\n\r\nCoins per Block: 610, \r\n\r\nPremine? Didn't know what it was until this moment, but seems usable and doable. \r\n\r\nDifficulty Adjustment? Once a day \r\n\r\nDoes it support AuxPow? Yes it will, once the project is done. \r\n\r\nAre there Plans to launch a Website for this? Absolutely, I plan on moving away from GitHub for my hosting very soon, this just is for the project. \r\n\r\nA Mining pool? When I complete it I will see if there's interest. \r\n\r\nHave you talked to exchanges on supporting it? I've been looking into it, I hope to some day have it on an exchange, or provide some sort of a solution. \r\n\r\n## Project Information\r\n\r\nCALCOINS\r\nTHEY WERE ALREADY HERE\r\n\r\nStatus\r\n* Have a working test server + Genesis Block \r\n\r\n* Debugging (a decent amount) \r\n\r\n* My friend Hannah is working on the small little graphical things for the wallet program, one of my major obstacles.

But I am still going to develop and publish this. Homestuck is property of Andrew Hussie and What Pumpkin, and this project is being done under the suggestion that the fandom make the coin.\r\n\r\nLINKS \r\n\r\n[THE REPO](https://www.github.com/acgh213/CALCOINS)\r\n\r\nfeel free to roll through it and if you see an issue please report it.\r\n\r\n[Site](https://acgh213.github.io/CALCOINS)\r\n\r\n***\r\n \r\nThank you, and feel free to send me messages about any thoughts,  comments,  or concerns\r\n\r\nIn all honesty, made my me, acgh213, and with a fork from https://github.com/natalietoday/boondollars by /u/Natalietoday on reddit and all the people attriubuted within the project (bitching,  altcoin, foocoin) I thank you for help with some of the values and helping me with the light issue I had with the timing. \r\n","google":"UA-56578130-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
