===========
Visit the website:http://acgh213.github.io/CALCOINS/ 

Calcoin (Or CAL) is a cryptocurrency (Or virtual currency) based off of Homestuck. Homestuck is a popular webcomic created by Andrew Hussie. In this comic a currency called "Calcoin" was mentioned and in a blog post he mentioned how he wanted to make the currency real but due to a lack of knowledge on the subject he cancelled development on the cryptocurrency.

However, this project wants to revive this idea by making the cryptocurrency the community needs. So, download today and join our community on Reddit (http://www.reddit.com/r/CALCOINS_QT/ ).

The current status of the build is the linux cli is complete, mac and windows are next. (If anyone wants to help out feel free.) 
The next thing is the GUI, which is being worked on and will be launched when it is ready.

Still searching for a way for convert this to bitcoin at a time in the future for everyone, so we can assign it value. I've been discussing it with a few people.


All credit comes to Andrew Hussie, and What Pumpkin, for the ownership for Homestuck, its character and ideas.
