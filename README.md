Calcoin; A Homestuck Cryptocurrency.
===========

Calcoin (Or CAL) is a cryptocurrency (Or virtual currency) based off of Homestuck. Homestuck is a popular webcomic created by Andrew Hussie. In this comic a currency called "Calcoin" was mentioned and in a blog post he mentioned how he wanted to make the currency real but due to a lack of knowledge on the subject he cancelled development on the cryptocurrency.

However, this project wants to revive this idea by making the cryptocurrency the community needs. So, download today and join our community on Reddit (http://www.reddit.com/r/CALCOINS_QT/ ).
