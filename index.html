<a id="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h2>

<p>I'm here to offer my own altcoin clone using the name CALCOINS,  although the project will be referred to as CALCOINS_QT online to refrain from confusion. </p>

<p>The wallet will be multiplatform on Windows, Mac, and PC.  And hopefully android (if this project doesn't die)</p>

<h2>
<a id="specs" class="anchor" href="#specs" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Specs</h2>

<p>Coincap: 41300000000 CAL</p>

<p>Blocktime: 30 seconds</p>

<p>Coins per Block: 610, </p>

<p>Premine? Didn't know what it was until this moment, but seems usable and doable. </p>

<p>Difficulty Adjustment? Once a day </p>

<p>Does it support AuxPow? Yes it will, once the project is done. </p>

<p>Are there Plans to launch a Website for this? Absolutely, I plan on moving away from GitHub for my hosting very soon, this just is for the project. </p>

<p>A Mining pool? When I complete it I will see if there's interest. </p>

<p>Have you talked to exchanges on supporting it? I've been looking into it, I hope to some day have it on an exchange, or provide some sort of a solution. </p>

<p>I know as a fandom we've had many different attempts to start this project,  and many different stages in the projects have been reached and maybe some are done and beat me to it. But I am still going to develop and publish this. Homestuck is property of Andrew Hussie and What Pumpkin, and this project is being done under the suggestion that the fandom make the coin.</p>
